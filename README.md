# Fasting Pandas - A guide into optimizing your data analytics processing

Welcome to Fasting Pandas, a tutorial on optimizing your data analytics processing using Python and Pandas. In this guide, we'll explore various techniques and best practices to help you get the most out of your data processing code.

## Getting Started

To get started with Fasting Pandas, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a Python virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal: 
``` python
python -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal: 
```
source env/bin/activate
```
on Windows, run 
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal: 
```
jupyter notebook
```
6. Navigate to the lesson you wish to work on, and open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file.

## Introduction

Fasting is a practice that has been used for centuries to improve health and wellness. The idea behind fasting is to limit the amount of energy your body spends on digestion, so it can use that energy for other processes, such as healing and repair. Similarly, optimizing your code can help you save time and resources, allowing you to focus on other important tasks.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to optimize your data processing code using Pandas. We'll look at various techniques and best practices, and benchmark the results to see the impact of these optimizations.

## Lessons

This tutorial is divided into three main lessons:

### Lesson 1: Conditionals

In this lesson, we'll explore how to properly apply transformation functions to Python dataframes. We'll look at functions such as apply, map, and vectorization, and discuss best practices for using them effectively.

### Lesson 2: Data Parsing

In this lesson, we'll look into the benefits of parsing the correct data type for the columns we use for our data processing. We'll explore how to identify and parse various data types, and discuss how this can improve performance and accuracy.

### Lesson 3: Reading and Writing

In this lesson, we'll explore the different file formats that are commonly used for data science, including CSV, JSON, Pickle, and Parquet. We'll discuss the benefits and limitations of each format, and explore how to read and write data using these formats.

## Conclusion

Optimizing your code is an important part of data analytics processing. By applying the techniques and best practices discussed in this tutorial, you can improve the performance and accuracy of your code, allowing you to focus on other important tasks.

We hope you enjoy this tutorial, and we look forward to hearing about your experiences with optimizing your data processing code using Pandas.
